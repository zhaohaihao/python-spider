# Python crawler about bank sites

The crawler focuses on bank outlets<br />
The main function in the program sets the memory switch<br />
This allows you to choose whether data needs to be stored or produced in JSON files<br />
You can enter the code of the corresponding provinces, cities and regions in the main function for individual data crawling<br /><br />

The crawled data is kept in the directory of the current program<br />
Because data cannot be unified in cleaning, a lot of unusual conditions arise<br />
So, I just have been crawled two banks only
